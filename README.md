# Neovim_Config

This repo resides the [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) configs that I use for my nvim editor. Inspired by [josean_dev](https://github.com/josean-dev/dev-environment-files).

I try to make neovim perform somehow close to a real IDE only to make myself comfortable working with it.

I use [Packer](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim) for plugin management

Some of the plugins I use:
- Nightfly theme
- nvim-tree
- comment
- lualine

Known Dependencies:
- Make / Cmake
- Node / npm
- clang / gcc
